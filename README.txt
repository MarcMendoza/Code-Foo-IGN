Thank you for looking at my submission.

This entire submission was done using html and javascript in order to ensure
that whichever system looks at it the viewer will be able to load it. The 
main page is the index.html and it contains answers to all the questions with
a link to the code for question 2.

Please note, that the connect 4 is incomplete but the base of the program was setup and included.

INSTRUCTIONS:
Pull repository, open index.html
