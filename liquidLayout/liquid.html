	Question 2: Liquid Layout Code
	Summary: This is a basic setup of a liquid layout that has 2 different css
				that is referenced based on the width of the window. The boxes
				marked as "Section #" will either be in a single column if 
				the width of the window is less than 1050 or two columns if it
				is greater than 1050. The height from the question was not 
				taken into account because basing the layout on height seemed 
				impractical. This is because the width should be the only 
				thing that is dynamic as this simply will reposition the text 
				to be longer on the screen while height would only allow more 
				of the screen to be visible at once.-->
